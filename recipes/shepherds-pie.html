      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        English readers should avert their eyes from the travesty that follows.
        This is not a recipe for a traditional shepherd's pie (it doesn't even
        have lamb in it!), but for us poor souls who don't know any better, it's
        a quick, easy, and delicious meal that's sure to please. Maybe another
        name would be better for this distinctly American evolution of the
        traditional recipe. Cowboy's Pie? Rancher's Pie? Whatever you call it,
        almost every family throughout the American South and Midwest has their
        own version of this classic. What follows is our family's way of doing
        it, passed down and altered by each generation going back as far as we
        can remember.
